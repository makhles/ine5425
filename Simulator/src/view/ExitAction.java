/**
 *  This class will create and dispatch a WINDOW_CLOSING event to the active

 *  event will be executed. Since clicking on the "Close" button of the
 *  frame/dialog or selecting the "Close" option from the system menu also
 *  invoke the WindowListener, this will provide a common exit point for
 *  the application.
